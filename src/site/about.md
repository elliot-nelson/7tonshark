## Work

üëã Hi! My name is Elliot Nelson, and I'm a software engineer with over 20 years of experience. I've built applications, websites, software for in-home and in-vehicle systems, and CI/CD pipelines, for companies ranging from tiny startups to huge corporations.

‚ö° Today, my focus is on CI/CD pipelines and related build tools. I'm passionate about increasing developer productivity through better tooling and processes.

üßë‚Äçüíª One thing I love about build tooling is that it's best when done out in the open, as contributions to an open-source project. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/elliot-nelson) for examples of the open-source projects I've contributed to.

## Play

üéÑ I look forward to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) each December, it's an opportunity to hack on something a bit different and solve some logic/algorithm puzzles.

üïπÔ∏è I also look forward to [js13k](https://js13kgames.com/) each August-September, a lightweight web-based browser game jam.

üéÆ When I need a break from coding, I like to sit down in front of the PlayStation -- I'm a big fan of large complex worlds like the Soulsborne games, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc.

## js13k Game Projects

* [Harold is Heavy](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2023-harold-is-heavy) was my 2023 entry for #js13k. A silly, colorful platformer about landing on enemies and rescuing friends. Also see my [post-jam blog post](/posts/making-of-js13k-2023-harold-is-heavy) about this game.

* [Moth](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2022-moth) was my 2022 entry for #js13k. So far, I think, this is my best-looking game, with nice blocky pixel art and a clearly defined palette. For more thoughts, check out my [post-jam blog post](/posts/making-of-js13k-2022-moth/).

* [Shadow of the Keening Star](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2021-keening-star) was my 2021 entry for #js13k. This was a lot of fun, it's a short ASCII roguelike plus text-based adventure game, which has a lot of promise. If I ever get the time, I'd enjoy sprucing up the music and sound effects and mapping out a bunch more of the story, I found it surprisingly compelling once it was all put together.

* [WIZARD WITH A SHOTGUN](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2020-wizard-with-a-shotgun) was my 2020 entry for #js13k. It‚Äôs a top-down 2D pixel art shooter, and probably the closest I‚Äôve gotten to a complete game - sound, music, a little dialog, basic animations, a little bit of story, etc. This was fun to put together and came out pretty close to the way I imagined it.

* [Letchworth Village](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2019-letchworth-village) was my 2019 entry for #js13k. Unfortunately this one had to be shipped half-finished, as I didn‚Äôt have time that year to complete it, but I still enjoy the aesthetic. I also wrote this one in TypeScript, which was interesting but probably not an experiment I'll try again for a small project like this.

* [Raven](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2018-raven) was my 2018 entry for #js13k. It‚Äôs a top-down 2D stealth game and involved a lot of raycasting math, which was a fun way to dust off stuff I loved working on many years ago.
