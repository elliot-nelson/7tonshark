## LadderJS

A JavaScript recreation of the 1982 CP/M game "Ladder", a game I played for countless hours on a Kaypro II when I was much younger.

## js13k Game Projects

### Harold is Heavy (2023)

* [Harold is Heavy](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2023-harold-is-heavy) was my 2023 entry for #js13k. A silly, colorful platformer about landing on enemies and rescuing friends. Also see my [post-jam blog post](/posts/making-of-js13k-2023-harold-is-heavy) about this game.

### Moth (2022)

* [Moth](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2022-moth) was my 2022 entry for #js13k. So far, I think, this is my best-looking game, with nice blocky pixel art and a clearly defined palette. For more thoughts, check out my [post-jam blog post](/posts/making-of-js13k-2022-moth/).

### Shadow of the Keening Star (2021)

* [Shadow of the Keening Star](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2021-keening-star) was my 2021 entry for #js13k. This was a lot of fun, it's a short ASCII roguelike plus text-based adventure game, which has a lot of promise. If I ever get the time, I'd enjoy sprucing up the music and sound effects and mapping out a bunch more of the story, I found it surprisingly compelling once it was all put together.

### WIZARD WITH A SHOTGUN (2020)

* [WIZARD WITH A SHOTGUN](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2020-wizard-with-a-shotgun) was my 2020 entry for #js13k. It’s a top-down 2D pixel art shooter, and probably the closest I’ve gotten to a complete game - sound, music, a little dialog, basic animations, a little bit of story, etc. This was fun to put together and came out pretty close to the way I imagined it.

### Letchworth Village (2019)

* [Letchworth Village](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2019-letchworth-village) was my 2019 entry for #js13k. Unfortunately this one had to be shipped half-finished, as I didn’t have time that year to complete it, but I still enjoy the aesthetic. I also wrote this one in TypeScript, which was interesting but probably not an experiment I'll try again for a small project like this.

### Raven (2018)

* [Raven](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2018-raven) was my 2018 entry for #js13k. It’s a top-down 2D stealth game and involved a lot of raycasting math, which was a fun way to dust off stuff I loved working on many years ago.
