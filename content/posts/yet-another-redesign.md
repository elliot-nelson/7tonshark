I'm taking a couple weeks off for Christmas, so what better time to finally get around to a long-awaited overhaul of my personal blog?

Highlights:

 - Converted everything to the latest version of Eleventy (via `eleventy-base-blog`).
 - Tossed out my old white and blue theme in favor of retro black and green.
 - Tossed the Twitter/X "announcement" threads at bottom of each post.
 - Add _Giscus_ (https://giscus.app/) comment threads for each post.

I'm still working out a few CSS issues, but so far I'm liking the new streamlined style heading.

✌️ Peace out until 2024!
