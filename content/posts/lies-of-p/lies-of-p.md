A surprisingly good Soulslike with all the classic game feel and mechanics, I 100% recommend playing Lies of P. I've played through NG+4 and platinumed the game on PlayStation and it was fun all the way through the end.

> Lite Spoilers: I may mention some combat mechanics and the names of certain characters and weapons, but will avoid any story spoilers.

## Vibes

Feels a lot like Bloodborne, with a rainy Victorian England look, but with puppets instead of werewolves. The game has a bit more story than many Soulslikes, and as a result feels very linear, progressing steadily through discrete chapters. Though there are a few classic Dark Souls style shortcuts and loopbacks unlocked throughout the game, it doesn't really affect how you play.

## Combat Feel

The game plays about halfway between Bloodborne and Dark Souls. Fable Arts, similar to Weapon Arts in Elden Ring, are different for each weapon and offer powered-up moves for dealing with difficult enemies. An interesting twist this game has is the ability to customize weapons by attaching different blades and handles, which lets you experiment with different combinations of move sets, weapon arts, and weapon types. This combined with a Sekiro-style prosethic arm that you can swap out gives you a lot of options in combat (although you'll find that some of the options are much stronger than others).

## Heavy Metal

Lies of P offers one weapon, Noblesse Oblige, that gives a respectable endgame experience: great damage, good moveset, and a hyperarmor fable art. Unfortunately, it's a club, not a greatsword, so the range is mediocre (with exception of the running jump attack). There is a weapon, Frozen Feast, that _wants_ to be this game's ultra greatsword, but in my opinion the weird moveset and fable art isn't worth it.

## Endgame

Heavy on story, the game offers 3 different endings, so playing through at least NG+2 is worth it, and during those runs you'll discover the +1 and +2 variants of armor pieces and rings typical to Souls games.

However, there's a heavy softcap on damage stats above 60 points, and increasing the NG+ level doesn't introduce any upgraded enemies or additional spawns, so the game will feel very "same" after a few playthroughs. (This could change in a future DLC though!)

## Difficulty

In my opinion, this game isn't particularly difficult. About half the boss fights allow you to summon a spectral helper which acts as a meatshield and will trivialize the fight; the ones that don't are generally the standard big, clunky boss that will feel familiar to any Souls player. (Note that the "final final" secret boss is an exception to this rule, it's actually pretty tough.)

_Note: I played this game after all the initial balancing patches, so my experience is different than those who played it on launch day._

## Multiplayer

No multiplayer of any kind.
