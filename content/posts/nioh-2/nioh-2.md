Easily one of my favorite Soulslikes and favorite games period -- I can't recommend it enough. I played the Complete Edition with all DLC from top to bottom on PlayStation, platinumed it, finished all trophies for the DLC, and then unlocked all in-game Titles, so I'm including all of that in the recap below.

> Lite Spoilers: I may mention some combat mechanics and the names of certain characters and weapons, but will avoid any story spoilers.

## Vibes

Fuedal Japan with all the trappings. You play a samurai, fighting other human samurai and various demons.

Like Nioh, each "level" of the game is its own discrete area, with a map that ties it all together. Once you enter a level, you need to finish it to keep any earned souls and items (although you do eventually get some items that let you escape a difficult level and keep what you've collected so far).

## Combat Feel

In my opinion, the combat is great. It doesn't really feel like a Souls game, but if you take a Sekiro, a Dynasty Warriors, and a Ninja Gaiden and munge them all up together you get close. There are many weapons to choose from, each weapon with an extensive skill tree that unlocks various moves. There are more moves to unlock than there are buttons to press (realistically between the light, heavy, and special attacks you can equip around 10 useful moves), which forces you to decide what moves work best for your playstyle.

## Heavy Metal

The closest thing to a greatsword in this game is the Odachi, and it's what I used for my entire playthrough (except when I was farming other weapons to finish out my Title list). The playstyle and pace of this game just doesn't allow for the super-slow, super-heavy weapons I enjoy.

Luckily, the Odachi itself is a _very_ well-rounded weapon -- good range, good damage, good stagger damage, and a nice mix of specialty anti-demon and anti-human moves that allow you to do just about anything.

## Endgame

In my opinion, the absolute pinnacle of New Game+. There are 5 difficulty levels, and each one is a "cliff" as you start the next difficulty -- you'll immediately feel very undergeared until you manage to scrounge up a few good upgrades, at which point you can catapult through the majority of the game until the back end, climb through some boss fights, and then tackle the next tier.

The game keeps it fresh by introducing new equipment slots, new gear rarity levels, and new enemy mechanics at each new difficulty tier. Old enemies are replaced by beefier versions, or have faster attacks or new moves and dodge abilities, and bosses have new phases or increased defense against various element types.

Once you've defeated all of these difficult tiers, there's the true Endgame which is 80 levels of Underworld, followed by 30 levels of Underworld Abyss. (This is what Bloodborne Chalice Dungeons _wanted_ to be, but in my opinion, never quite achieved.)

## Difficulty

This game can be brutally unfair. It doesn't necessarily require frame-perfect parrying or blocking or dodging, but you'll encounter scenarios that just seem unbeatable, and then eventually, you'll beat them. The answer might be better gear, it might be mixing up your ninjutsu or magic abilities, it might be swapping to a different weapon for part of the fight. Or, it might just be getting lucky -- there are some randomized bosses (_cough_ Lightning God of Yomi _cough_) that, if you meet them in the endgame Underworld Abyss, might just be "die and hope for a better dice roll next time".

## Multiplayer

Souls-style invasions aren't part of this game, although you can choose to fight AI-controlled "ghosts" of players who have died (a twist on the Souls bloodstain mechanic). Because you have a chance to loot copies of the gear the ghost is wearing, some players cleverly abuse this mechanic to "share" particularly good gear with others by dying in predetermined spots.

You can also play cooperatively through entire levels or specific boss fights, and matchup and search functionality is pretty good.
