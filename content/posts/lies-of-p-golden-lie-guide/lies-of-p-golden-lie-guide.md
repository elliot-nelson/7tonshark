Obtaining the secret weapon **Golden Lie** requires maxing out your Humanity. As far as I know, this is a hidden stat and no one knows _exactly_ how it works, but I've obtained Golden Lie twice (once through the Free from the Puppet Strings Ending, once through the Rise of P ending), so I'm confident about the results, if not the details.

By my estimation, obtaining Golden Lie requires **34** humanity, which you can obtain by telling **15 lies**, listening to **8 records**, answering **5 riddles**, and completing **6 special interactions** that give humanity. You do not need to follow up on any cryptic vessel locations, you do not need to actually open any of the Trinity Doors (except the final one), and you do not need to answer "Give her peace" to Sophia's last request.

> This guide assumes you've played through the game a couple times and know roughly where everything is. Consider it a checklist and not a full walkthrough.

 - **INTERACTION #6** After defeating Laxasia the Complete, interact with Sophie and choose _either_ option. Note that choosing "Give her peace" will unlock the good ending, Rise of P, and grant the additional record _Shadow Flower_. Choosing "Let her live" unlocks the mediocre ending, Freed from the Puppet Strings, and does not grant the additional record.
 - **RECORD #8** In the hotel, return to Antonia to obtain record _Memory of Beach_.
 - **LIE #15** In Arche Abbey, speak to Gepetto and choose "Yes".

After completing all above and listening to all the records, you should be at the Stargazer immediately before the final boss fight with Simon Manus, with enough humanity to obtain the Golden Lie _before_ fighting Simon.

If you've missed something and you're going for the Rise of P ending, the extra record _Shadow Flower_ may make up the difference. If not, there's an additional record, _Misty E'rA_, obtainable at the end of Hermit's Cave after giving Venigni the Rusty Cryptic Vessel.
