An indie soulslike. Rough around the edges, but overall an enjoyable, fairly short experience with challenging bosses. It's not top-tier, but it's definitely worth playing.

> Lite Spoilers: I may mention some combat mechanics and the names of certain characters and weapons, but will avoid any story spoilers.

## Vibes

Run-down medieval swamps, villages, and crumbling castles. Reminds me a bit of another indie soulslike, Mortal Shell. The game is played in individual levels (technically "memories", like in Assassin's Creed), with several quests to complete in each main area.

## Combat Feel

Your equipment is fixed and combat (especially in boss fights) is parry-heavy, very reminiscent of Sekiro. However, you can make use of special moves that you "steal" from enemies and can unlock for permanent use, which give you many options to choose from such as greatsword, knife, bow, etc., which adds some variety to your attacks.

The game has a unique mechanic of standard (saber) damage, which leaves wounds, and claw attacks, which "lock in" the damage by knocking off the wound bar. Wound damage will swiftly regenerate if you leave an enemy alone for a couple seconds, so the game forces you to develop a rhythm of applying damage and then locking it in. (Later, some of the special moves you can pick from are very useful for locking in wound damage.)

## Heavy Metal

The Greatsword and Giant Sword special moves do allow just a taste of greatsword game play, but for the most part, the combat rhythm of Thymesia doesn't support this playstyle.

## Endgame

Low scores here, as the game does not offer any kind of replay or NG+ capability. It does offer a few different endings, and if you go for the platinum there's a little bit of replayability to finish collectibles and such.

## Difficulty

Most of the common enemies in this game won't present a challenge, but the bosses might seem like a difficulty spike for some people -- there are some bosses I simply couldn't beat without memorizing parry timing.

## Multiplayer

No multiplayer of any kind.

## Verdict
