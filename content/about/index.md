# About Me

## Work

👋 Hi! My name is Elliot Nelson, and I'm a software engineer with over 20 years of experience. I've built applications, websites, software for in-home and in-vehicle systems, and CI/CD pipelines, for companies ranging from tiny startups to huge corporations.

⚡ Today, my focus is on CI/CD pipelines and related build tools. I'm passionate about increasing developer productivity through better tooling and processes.

🧑‍💻 One thing I love about build tooling is that it's best when done out in the open, as contributions to an open-source project. Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/elliot-nelson) for examples of the open-source projects I've contributed to.

## Play

🎄 I look forward to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) each December, it's an opportunity to hack on something a bit different and solve some logic/algorithm puzzles.

🕹️ I also look forward to [js13k](https://js13kgames.com/) each August-September, a lightweight web-based browser game jam. Check out my list of past js13k Game Projects on my [Projects](/projects) page.

🎮 When I need a break from coding, I like to sit down in front of the PlayStation -- I'm a big fan of large complex worlds like the Soulsborne games, Ghost of Tsushima, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc. See also my [Dark Souls](/darksouls) page.
