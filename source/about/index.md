This is the personal blog of Elliot Nelson.

Professionally, I'm a software engineer who has spent a lot of time writing enterprise Java &amp; C#, mountains of Ruby, HTML, CSS, SQL, and all their siblings; but, nowadays I spend most of my time tinkering with CI/CD pipelines and writing client- &amp; server-side JavaScript.

In my spare time I play some video games, watch some TV, solve some puzzles, and enjoy tinkering with JavaScript projects -- especially, seasonally, [js13kgames](https://js13kgames.com/) and [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Personal Projects

- [WIZARD WITH A SHOTGUN](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2020-wizard-with-a-shotgun) was my 2020 entry for #js13k. It's a top-down 2D pixel art shooter, and probably the closest I've gotten to a complete game - sound, music, a little dialog, basic animations, a little bit of story, etc. This was fun to put together and came out pretty close to the way I imagined it.

- [Letchworth Village](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2019-letchworth-village) was my 2019 entry for #js13k. Unfortunately this one had to be shipped half-finished, as I didn't have time that year to complete it, but I still enjoy the aesthetic. This entry is notable in that I wrote it in TypeScript, which was interesting but I probably won't do again.

- [Raven](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/js13k-2018-raven) was my 2018 entry for #js13k. It's a top-down 2D stealth game and involved a lot of raycasting math, which was a fun way to dust off stuff I loved working on many years ago.

- [awesome-branch-name](https://github.com/elliot-nelson/awesome-branch-name) is a silly tool that generates branch names for you based on Magic: the Gathering card names. I use this almost every day and enjoy updating it once a year or so to include new card names.

## Theme

- This site is generated using Hexo, with a tweaked version of the [Clean Blog](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) theme from [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) (adapted for Hexo by [Jonathan Klughertz](http://www.codeblocq.com/)).

- Syntax highlighting theme is _An Old Hope_ from [highlightjs](https://highlightjs.org/static/demo/), tweaked slightly to look good on the page and to look a little more like An Old Hope in VSCode.

What's good?

This blog!
The best editor: VSCode
The best theme: An Old Hope
The best font: DejaVu Sans Mono (@300 Font Weight)
Worth mentioning: Inconsolata, Fira Mono, and Fira Code all look cooler than DejaVu. But, I get the maximum number of hours of strain-free eyeballs with this font, so it's my workhorse.
And of course, https://github.com/VSCodeVim/Vim
