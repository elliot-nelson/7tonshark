## Resurrecting the personal blog

I recently participated in a code competition, [js13kgames](http://js13kgames.com), for the first time, and it has resulted in kind of a chain reaction. It really invigorated me to do some research on a bunch of interesting gaming-related concepts, and as a related project, to reboot my personal blog.

So, here's a "first post" on a brand new website. My plan, for what it's worth, is to post one article a month leading up to next year's js13k competition, each one about some aspect of building small javascript games on the web. (Maybe some other topics will sneak in there too, but no promises.)

Hopefully, I'll see you around. Cheers!
