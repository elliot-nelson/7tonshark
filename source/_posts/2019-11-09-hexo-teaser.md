## Switching to Hexo

Been a busy year this year, so the blog has fallen by the wayside. That's not likely
to change until early 2020, but I am working on rebuilding (and re-styling) the blog
in [Hexo](https://hexo.io/), rather than Jekyll.

I'm still a fan of Jekyll, but as I get more involved in nodejs open-source projects, my
desire to write Ruby has declined. It'll be interesting to see how mature the Hexo
experience is now that it's been around a while.
